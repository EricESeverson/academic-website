I'm currently teaching math and computer science at Proof School in San Francisco.

I like making nice math visuals. Lately I've been making {{< staticref "https://www.geogebra.org/u/ericseverson" "newtab" >}}a lot of interactive things with Geogebra{{< /staticref >}}, as well as Desmos. I also have a {{< staticref "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfU-vYWbxA0" "newtab" >}}couple{{< /staticref >}} {{< staticref "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct7oltmdJrM" "newtab" >}}videos{{< /staticref >}} I made for the 3b1b Summer of Math Exposition.
