I'm currently teaching math and computer science at Proof School in San Francisco.

I like making nice math visuals. Lately I've been making {{< staticref "https://www.geogebra.org/u/ericseverson" "newtab" >}}a lot of interactive things with Geogebra{{< /staticref >}}.

I also tried learning {{< staticref "https://www.manim.community/" "newtab" >}}the Manim animation library{{< /staticref >}} and made {{< staticref "[https://www.manim.community/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct7oltmdJrM&ab_channel=EricSeverson)" "newtab" >}}one video{{< /staticref >}} for a contest the other summer.
